				<Heading>Core Decision Making</Heading>
			</FlexBox>
			<Notes>
				Jorbin: The core team engages in consensus seeking to make
				decisions. That means we try to seek out all opinions and find
				the best ones that lack strong opposition. Disagree and commit.
				Strong opinions loosely held. It&apos;s perfectly reasonable to
				disagree. But we must push forward.

				<Heading>Who Decides When to Release</Heading>
			</FlexBox>
			<Notes>
				Jon: There is no one person who decides when to release. It is a
				team decision. The release lead is the final decision maker.
				Matt is rarely involved in the decision. the process takes place
				in public and anyone can participate.

					Not Being Able to Update is a Security Concern
				</Heading>
			</FlexBox>
			<Notes>
				Jon: One of the most important ways to keep a site secure is to
				keep it updated. In the instance of 6.4.1, the pain of a bug
				that could block websites from updating was considered a
				security concern.
